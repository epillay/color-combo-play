// DOCUMENTATION

// a program that allows random drawing of rectangles, triangles, and ellpises in a chosen color and transparency
// both with fill and no fill

// controls:
// 'r' = reset/clear screen
// 's' = toggles through different shapes
// 'f' = fill or no fill
// ' ' = pause/play

// changes made from critique:
// - font style changed
// - layout changed (text is displayed at the bottom with color pickers)
// - shape/fill is represented visually instead of textually
// - tick rate is slower for drawing (draw every tick % 2 instead of tick)
// - added lines to create a cleaner panel organization at the bottom of the screen

// changes not implemented:
// - displaying all of the key press commands since I felt that it would crowd up the screen and I can display these 
// instructions in open processing's description feature
